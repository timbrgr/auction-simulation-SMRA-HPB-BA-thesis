%TODO: Acknowledgments
I dedicate my gratitude to Andor Goetzendorff, without his constant and relentless support this project would have never come to life. I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned so much under his supervision.

%Also I would like to thank Mr. Felix Schober for always reminding me what true friendship looks like.

Also, I want to thank my parents. Without their unalterable trust in my potential, despite the contradictions raised through out my life, I would never have come so far in achieving my goals and dreams. 

This work is dedicated to my mother. May she rest in peace.
