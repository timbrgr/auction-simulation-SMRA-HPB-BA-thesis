\chapter{Experimental Design}\label{chapter:experiment}
This chapter first describes the data of the German spectrum auction from 2015. Afterwards, a value model is introduced that was built from the insights of the data analysis and various external resources to describe the valuation of each bidder in the auction. The value model serves as a cornerstone of the simulation in \autoref{chapter:implementation}.

\section{Data from the German Spectrum Auction 2015}
To simulate the German spectrum auction "Mobiles Breitband - Projekt 2016" (MBP16, see \autoref{sec:MBP16}) a value model needs to be derived for each bidder in the auction. To achieve that, the respective data was analysed to give insights into bidding behaviour and valuation.

\subsection{Data Aquisition}
The German Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) made the MBP16 data publicly available online \footnote{\url{http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Sachgebiete/Telekommunikation/Unternehmen_Institutionen/Frequenzen/OeffentlicheNetze/Mobilfunknetze/Projekt2016/projekt2016-node.html} (accessed on 11/07/2016)}.
The data contains the highest bidder and the winning bid for each block in each round, as well as the the summed value of all retracted bids (see an example in \autoref{fig:r181data}). During the auction every bidder could see the bids placed by their competitors after each round ended. This data is not contained in the public data set. %TODO ref MBP16 manual

\end{figure}

As the round data was published as image files, there was a need to systematically extract the information from the images and save it to a suitable data format. To achieve this, a python script %TODO input code reference
was used to load all the images and used Optical Character Recognition (OCR), a computer vision algorithm for pattern recognition, to scan them. Afterwards, all the data was written into a CSV file.

\subsection{Spectrum specific Information}\label{subsection:spec_specif_info}
Before building the model for the German spectrum auction in 2015, it is of help to look at the probable usage of the different frequency bands as they give clues to the bidders' valuation. \autoref{tbl:spectrumQuickInfo} gives an overview of the information given in BICHLER2016 %cite Bichler2016
on how the different bands might be used after the auction. Note, that due to its relatively small importance in the auction, the 1500 MHz band will be excluded from the simulation and thus the value model (e. g. TEF did not even bid in this band).

\textbf{700 MHz}: This spectrum was of importance as this band was not held by any of the MNOs before the auction. Its usage after the auction is most likely enabling LTE for their customers. Due to better propagation characteristics of lower frequency bands the 700 MHz is of great value to the participating bidders. 

\textbf{900 MHz}: Similar to the 700 MHz band, the 900 MHz spectrum is a low frequency band that is of great value to the MNOs. Following BICHLER2016 %TODO cite Bichler2016
the value of acquiring three blocks in this spectrum is much higher than that of two blocks. As with three blocks a bidder can use two of them for LTE or use all of them for GSM this flexibility adds a big surplus on this bundling. Important to note is the spectrum cap of 3 blocks per bidder in the auction. The cap was incorporated to ensure that every bidder at least acquires one block in this band.

\textbf{1800 MHz}: BBLA

\textbf{1500 MHz}: The 1500 band experienced only small competition 
Thus, this spectrum will be excluded from the simulation to focus on the more important frequency bands.

%\caption{Information concerning the value model about offered spectrums} %TODO cite Bichler2016
%\end{table}

From the table it can be seen that in particular the bundling of three blocks in 900 MHz as well as bundling 4 or 6 blocks together in 1800 MHz is of great value for the bidders due to their potential usage for LTE. This has to be included into the value model.


\section{Value Model}
To simulate the bidding behaviour a value model is needed. The value model is a function $$ v: (input) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} $$ that, given a certain set of bidding items, determines the valuation of bidding items of a bidder. During the simulation, each bidding agent can compute its internal valuation for each bidding combination and thus determine it's bidding strategy. Hence, The value model is key to the auction simulation. %TODO ref chapter 5 here

Forging all the information from the preceding sections into a model to describe the valuation of the bidders results in the following mathematical formulation. Each mobile network operator $MNO \in \{TEF, DT, VOD\}$ can bid on any number of available blocks $q_{700}, q_{900}, q_{1800} \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ in the frequency bands included in the simulation (700 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz). Additionally, the values for single items and bundles of items have to be incorporated into the model. As stated in \autoref{tbl:spectrumQuickInfo}, bundles of 3 blocks in 900 MHz as well as 4 and 6 blocks in the 1800 MHz bands have a major additional value in comparison to the normal multiples of the baseline valuations due to their usefulness in enabling LTE. Due to the high competition and prices in the 1800 MHz band it was unlikely that one of the participating MNOs would achieve the bundling of six blocks in this spectrum. Accounting for this fact, the six-block-bundle was not incorporated into the value model.
To formulate the bundling options, band specific constants are introduced into the model. Let $items \in \{700, 900, 900_{3}, 1800, 1800_{4}\}$ be the set of different item combinations, where $\{700, 900, 1800\}$ stand for the valuation of one single item in the respective band and $\{900_{3}, 1800_{4}\}$ for the bundles of respective band items.

Multiplying the quantities with the respective single item valuation $ V_{MNO}^{items} $ and adding the bundle effects yields the respective valuation for each bidder and each combination. 

\begin{align}
v: (q_{700}, q_{900}, q_{1800}) &\longrightarrow&& \mathbb{R} \label{eq:vMNOabstract} \\
v_{MNO}(q_{700}, q_{900}, q_{1800}) &=&& v_{700}(q_{700}) + v_{900}(q_{900}) + v_{1800}(q_{1800}) \label{eq:vMNO} \\
v_{700}(q_{700}) &=&& V_{MNO}^{700} * q_{700} \label{eq:v700} \\
v_{900}(q_{900}) &=&& V_{MNO}^{900} * q_{900} + \mathbb{1}_{\{q_{900} \geq 3\}}V_{MNO}^{900_{3}} \label{eq:v900} \\
v_{1800}(q_{1800}) &=&& V_{MNO}^{1800} * q_{1800} + \mathbb{1}_{\{q_{1800} \geq 4\}}V_{MNO}^{1800_{4}} \label{eq:v1800}
\end{align}

Note, that the spectrum cap of maximum three blocks per MNO is not depicted in the value model itself, but will be in the implemented in the auction model (see %TODO ref simulation chapter
).

As stated in BICHLER %TODO cite Bichler2016
and seen in the data analysis section before, the prices of the auction items were merely a function of the cooperation and competition strategies of the bidders and resulted in relatively low prices for the lower frequency bands. This is surprising as due to the better propagation properties the prices of lower frequency bands should have been higher. %TODO cite Bichler2016
To get a comparison and an understand of the 2015 prices, it is worthwhile looking  at the German spectrum auction of 2010 where similar spectrum was auctioned. \autoref{tbl:endroundmeanbids} shows the yielded mean prices of the offered spectrums. In 2010 the 800 MHz spectrum yielded a mean price of roughly EUR 600m per block, where as the 700 and 900 MHz spectrums in 2010 resulted in 166m and 194m respectively. The 800 MHz band in 2010 was destined to be used for LTE coverage, thus having a high potential to create competitive advantages in the downstream market. The 700 MHz band offered in 2015 will most likely be used for LTE, too. Therefore it is surprising that the auction yielded much lower prices. As noted before, cooperation between the bidders might be accountable for that.

\caption{Mean prices yielded for selected spectrum in the 2010 and 2015 auctions (prices in thousand EUR)}
\end{table}

To compute the different valuation constants of the $items$, a baseline model approach was chosen, with the baseline being the mean price paid by TEF in the 1800 MHz band at the end of the auction. The decision for this baseline was motivated by the fact that the bids for the 1800 MHz band were probably much closer the bidders' valuation after a long series of bidding rounds that let the prices in this band soar rapidly. The price inclination was so steep that afterwards the bidding war shifted from 1800 MHz to other bands to avoid further price increases. This might give a good indication that the bidders were nearing the point where prices might have exceed the bidders' valuation and thus being much closer to the true valuation than in other bands.
From the bids in the 1800 MHz band the TEF mean bid was chosen as I argue that TEF might have bid much closer to its own valuation. TEF merged with the German MNO E-plus only shortly before the beginning of the auction. The merger put stress on TEF's budget, leaving it a less powerful budget in comparison to DT and VOD.

All the single items valuations were derived by scaling based on assumptions regarding the spectrum specific characteristics $ \delta_{spectrum-relation} $ in comparison to the 1800 MHz band and the relative strength $ s_{MNO} $ of the participating bidders in comparison to TEF. Also, the prices from the 2010 and 2015 auction were taken into account.

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:scalingAll}
\begin{align}
V_{MNO}^{700} &= V_{TEF}^{1800} * \delta_{1800-700} * s_{MNO} \label{eq:oneItemScaling700} \\
V_{MNO}^{900} &= V_{TEF}^{1800} * \delta_{1800-900} * s_{MNO} \label{eq:oneItemScaling900} \\
V_{MNO}^{1800} &= V_{TEF}^{1800} * \delta_{1800-1800} * s_{MNO} \label{eq:oneItemScaling1800}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\autoref{tbl:deltasSMNOs} shows the chosen weighting factors $ \delta_{spectrum-relation} $ and  $ s_{MNO} $. The inter-spectrum scaling was chosen based on the prices for 800 MHz in the 2010 auction. $ \delta_{1800-700} $ got a higher weight as to reflect it usefulness to enable LTE. Also, $ s_{MNO} $ should reflect the budgets of each MNO, e. g. DT has a much higher budget (revenue of EUR 22.4bn\footnote{\url{https://www.telekom.com/konzern/weltweit/profile/23110} accessed on 22/07/2016} in 2015) than VOD (EUR 10.6bn\footnote{\url{http://www.vodafone.de/unternehmen/umsatz.html} accessed on 22/07/2016}) and especially TEF (EUR 7.9bn \footnote{\url{https://www.telefonica.de/file/public/826/Konzernabschluss_2015_TDH_deutsch_online.pdf?attachment=1} accessed on 22/07/2016}) after the merger.

\end{tabular}

\end{table}



To derive the bundle valuations, an additional scaling factor $ \beta_{item} $ is introduced.

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:bundleAll}
\begin{align}
V_{MNO}^{900_{3}} &= V_{MNO}^{900} * \beta_{900_{3}} \label{eq:bundleScaling900} \\
V_{MNO}^{1800_{4}} &= V_{MNO}^{1800} * \beta_{1800_{4}}  \label{eq:bundleScaling1800}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

For $ \beta_{900_{3}} = \beta_{1800_{4}} = 1 $ were chosen as they both reflect that the value of each bundles equals the value of acquiring one additional block. Following \autoref{eq:v900} and \autoref{eq:v1800} in case $  q_{900} \geq 3 $ or $ q_{1800} \geq 4  $, $ V_{MNO}^{900_{3}} $ or $ V_{MNO}^{1800_{4}} $ will be added as intra-band synergy surplus to the single item multiples in the respective band valuation.

From the formulations above now the actual values have to be derived. With the mean bid from TEF in the 1800 MHz band being EUR 239m and following the mathematical formulations in \autoref{eq:scalingAll} and \autoref{eq:bundleAll} the following valuations can be computed.

\begin{table}[ht]

\end{tabular}
\caption{Overview of the different valuation constants used in the value model}
\label{tbl:valuationConstants}
\end{table}

Due to the choice of $ \beta_{900_{3}} = \beta_{1800_{4}} = 1 $ the additional surplus equals the valuation for one single item in the respective spectrum.
Taking the formulations above together, a value model for the simulation can now be implemented (see %TODO ref chapter 5
).

the total of 23 items in each of the three bands 700, 900, 1800 were successively numbered, e.g. for the 900 MHz band: $ 900_1, 900_2, ..., 900_7 $. The collection of all items is called $ Items = \{700_1, ..., 700_6, 900_1, ...,  900_7, 1800_1, ..., 1800_{10}\} $ with their respective band subsets $ Items_{700}, Items_{900}, Items_{1800} $. 
To formulate the boni in the frequency bands 900 MHz and 1800 MHz (see \autoref{subsection:spec_specif_info}), two bonus variables $ bv900, b1800 \in \{0,1\}  $ are introduced.
