abstract = {A family of ascending package auction models is introduced in which bid- ders may determine their own packages on which to bid. In the proxy auction (revelation game) versions, the outcome is a point in the core of the exchange economy for the reported preferences. When payo s are linear in money and goods are substitutes, sincere reporting constitutes a Nash equilibrium and the outcome coincides with the Vickrey auction outcome. Even when goods are not substitutes, ascending proxy auction equilibria lie in the core with respect to the true preferences. Compared to the Vickrey auction, the proxy auctions generate higher equilibrium revenues, are less vulnerable to shill bidding and collusion, can handle budget constraints much more robustly, and may provide better ex ante investment incentives.},

Manage. Sci. 44, 1131-1147]. This combination provides the feedback necessary for bidders in multi-round auctions to discern winning bidding strategies for subsequent rounds and to coordinate responses to aggressive package bids. The resulting mechanism is compared to two leading alternatives in a series of laboratory experiments involving varying degrees of value synergies. Based on these "wind tunnel" tests the FCC has decided to use hierarchical package bidding in a segment of the upcoming 700 MHz auction. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Wellman2008,
abstract = {Simultaneous ascending auctions present agents with various strategic problems, depending on preference structure. As long as bids represent non-repudiable offers, submitting non-contingent bids to separate auctions entails an exposure problem: bidding to acquire a bundle risks the possibility of obtaining an undesired subset of the goods. With multiple goods (or units of a homogeneous good) bidders also need to account for their own effects on prices. Auction theory does not provide analytic solutions for optimal bidding strategies in the face of these problems. We present a new family of decision-theoretic bidding strategies that use probabilistic predictions of final prices: self-confirming distribution-prediction strategies. Bidding based on these is provably not optimal in general. But evidence using empirical game-theoretic methods we developed indicates the strategy is quite effective compared to other known methods when preferences exhibit complementarities. When preferences exhibit substitutability, simpler demand-reduction strategies address the own price effect problem more directly and perform better. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {A comprehensive book on combinatorial auctions―auctions in which bidders can bid on packages of items. The book consists of original material intended for researchers, students, and practitioners of auction design. It includes a foreword by Vernon Smith, an introduction to combinatorial auctions, and twenty-three cross-referenced chapters in five parts. Part I covers mechanisms, such as the Vickrey auction and the ascending proxy auction. Part II is on bidding and efficiency issues. Part III examines computational issues and algorithmic considerations, especially the winner determination problem―how to identify the (tentative) winning set of bids that maximizes revenue. Part IV discusses implementation and methods of testing the performance of combinatorial auctions, including simulation and experiment. Part V considers four important applications: airport runway access, trucking, bus routes, and industrial procurement. The chapters develop and apply a unified language, integrating ideas from economics, operations research, and computer science. A glossary defines the central terms.

abstract = {Motivated by the increasing use of auctions by government agencies, we consider the problem of fairly pricing public goods in a combinatorial auction. A well-known problem with the incentive-compatible Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism is that the resulting prices may not be in the core. Loosely speaking, this means the payments of the winners could be so low, that there are bidders who would have been willing to pay more than the payments of the winning bidders. Clearly, this "unfair" outcome is unacceptable for a public sector auction. Recent advances in auction theory suggest that combinatorial auctions resulting in efficient outcomes and bidder-Pareto-optimal core payments offer a viable practical alternative to address this problem. This paper confronts two critical issues facing the bidder-Pareto-optimal core payment. First, motivated to minimize a bidder's ability to benefit through strategic manipulation (through collusive agreement or unilateral action), we demonstrate the strength of a mechanism that minimizes total payments among all such auction outcomes, narrowing the previously broad solution concept. Second, we address the computational difficulties of achieving these outcomes with a constraint-generation approach, promising to broaden the range of applications for which bidder-Pareto-optimal core pricing achieves a comfortably rapid solution.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The three treatment variations spelled out in the Design Report implement changes in (1) the degree of valuation complementarities, (2) the degree of overlapping strength of national bidders, and (3) the relative strengths of national and regional bidders. There are two levels for each treatment, so this 2x2x2 design yields 8 variations for each of the two auction types for a total of 16 treatments. This report is based on results from 64 laboratory sessions, each consisting of 6 to 10 auctions. Data are posted online at the jAuctions website described in the report that follows. The multi-dimensional experiment design permits an evaluation of the effects of package bidding under a wide range of market conditions. The main results are: 1. With high complementarities, package bidding raises efficiency, which measures the extent to which the auction allocates licenses to those with the highest valuations. However, allowing for package bids reduces efficiency when value complementarities are absent or small. We conjecture this is caused by the SMRPB requirement that bidders can only have one bid accepted (the XOR rule) as it requires bidders to bid on many combinations of licenses to find all possible efficiency gains. 2. In contrast with previous studies that have found revenues to be higher with SMR due to “over exposure” and resulting bidder losses, we find that package bidding raises revenues in some cases and not in others. In particular, package bidding raises revenues in all treatments where the national bidders have interests that are not fully overlapping. In treatments with full overlap of nationals' interests, however, the introduction of package bidding lowers revenues slightly. We believe that the improved revenue results for package bidding reported here are caused, in part, by the license-price feedback central to the SMRPB format. 3. On average, the SMRPB auction requires about 20{\%} more rounds of bidding than the SMR auction. 4. All licenses are sold under SMRPB, whereas licenses sometimes remain unsold with SMR (in about 5{\%} of the cases with high complementarities, and rarely with low complementarities). The economic impact of unsold licenses in actual FCC auctions is diminished by the fact that these licenses are typically sold in subsequent auctions. To summarize, the efficiency advantage for package bidding seems to be persistent across environments with high complementarities, which generate the exposure problem that package bidding is intended to alleviate. This observation leads us to conjecture that the benefits of package bidding might be significant from an economic point of view.},
